# A repository that I use to practice python/R on via Binder. 
This isn't a repository on public display for showing off skills, it is purely for practice. 
Binder requires the repository to be public in order to access it. 
I loaded multiple datasets here to have a variaty of sets I can utilise practice new techniques or knowledge on.

Thank you :)
